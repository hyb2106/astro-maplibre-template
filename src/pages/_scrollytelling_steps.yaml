  description: This atlas serves to acknowledge the intentional effects of H-bomb testing on the Uyghur minority ethnic group in the Xinjiang Autonomous Prefecture, while exploring the nuanced nature of what hydrogen means to a rapidly changing society. Scroll to explore how both the weaponization and energization of hydrogen has shaped China-s cultural landscape.

  description: In 1964, China detonated its first H-bomb at Lop Nur, only 18 months after the country had achieved atomic fission as part of the “Two Bombs, One Satellite” program launched by Mao ZeDong. Geolocating the 45 known sites of H-bomb tests around Lop Nur Military base between 1967 and 1996.

  description: China refused to sign the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, arguing they were still developing their nuclear technology. There were several test ban treaties enacted over the 1970s and 1980s which China too avoided. External pressure forced Lop Nur to move its test operations to solely underground from 1976 onwards.

  description: The region was chosen on the basis of a risk assessment; it was relatively sparsely populated and benefitted from the open expanses and arid climate of the Gobi Desert. Yet that sparse population was that of the Uyghur people; a minority ethnic group that have been victim to extreme persecution in ongoing human rights violations that the Chinese government commits through forced re-education programs and systematic ethnic cleansing. Adding to these atrocities, decades of health implications from nuclear fallout in the region remain officially unreported and continue to harm residents and the environment.
