  description: The region was chosen on the basis of a risk assessment; it was relatively sparsely populated and benefitted from the open expanses and arid climate of the Gobi Desert. Yet that sparse population was that of the Uyghur people; a minority ethnic group that have been victim to extreme persecution in ongoing human rights violations that the Chinese government commits through forced re-education programs and systematic ethnic cleansing. Adding to these atrocities, decades of health implications from nuclear fallout in the region remain officially unreported and continue to harm residents and the environment.
