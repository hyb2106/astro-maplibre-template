  description: Hydrogen has played a defining role in both technological innovation and extreme devastation in China and across the globe. This atlas explores how both the weaponization and energization of hydrogen has shaped China's cultural landscape. In unpacking the nuances behind what hydrogen means to a rapidly changing society, this atlas serves to geolocate and acknowledge the continual effects of H-bomb testing on the Uyghur minority ethnic group in the Xinjiang Autonomous Prefecture. Scroll to learn more about China's hydrogen society.

  description: In 1964, China detonated its first H-bomb at Lop Nur, only 18 months after the country had achieved atomic fission as part of the “Two Bombs, One Satellite” program launched by Mao Zedong. The red dots here geolocate the 24 known sites of H-bomb atmospheric tests around Lop Nur Military base between 1964 and 1976.

  description: China refused to sign the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, arguing they were still developing their nuclear technology. There were several test ban treaties enacted over the 1970s and 1980s which China too avoided. External pressure forced Lop Nur to move its test operations to solely underground from 1976 onwards. Eventually, China signed the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty but has not ratified it.

  description: Almost as soon as H-bomb testing ceased, hydrogen was utilized as an energy solution. In the early 2000s, hydrogen was included as a potential solution to reduce oil dependency as part of the CCP's tenth 5-year plan. Since 2022, China has led global hydrogen production. These cyan dots geolocate all hydrogen producing power plants across the country as of 2024.

  description: The Xinjiang region was chosen for H-bomb testing on the basis of a risk assessment; it was relatively sparsely populated and benefitted from the open expanses and arid climate of the Gobi Desert. Yet that sparse population is that of the Uyghur people; a minority ethnic group that have been victim to extreme persecution in ongoing human rights violations commited by the Chinese government through forced re-education programs and systematic ethnic cleansing.
